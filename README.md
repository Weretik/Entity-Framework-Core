# Entity Framework Core – Practice Series

## Overview

This repository contains practical assignments completed while studying **Entity Framework Core**, a modern ORM framework for .NET. The course focuses on core EF Core functionality including modeling, relationships, LINQ queries, and raw SQL execution.

## Course Structure

### 1. Introduction to Entity Framework Core
- Created a console application using a list of `Product` objects
- Populated the list with 10 entries
- Displayed products at indices 1, 5, 0, 7
- Found and displayed indexes of products by `Id` at indices 1, 5
- Found and displayed indexes of products by `Name` at indices 0, 7

### 2. Creating Models in Entity Framework Core
- Limited all string properties using **Data Annotations** based on their purpose
- Renamed `Id` to `(ClassName)Id` convention
- Applied `DataType.Date` for `DateTime` fields
- Applied all changes to the database via migration
- Created an **enum** `StatusCode` with values: `Ok`, `NotFound`, `Server`
- Created a new class `Error` with properties: `Message`, `Time`, `Request`, `Status`
- Added `DbSet<Error>` to the database context
- Configured an additional field `(ClassName)AlterId` as part of a composite key via **Fluent API**
- Configured the `Error` type to be **ignored** in the database via Fluent API
- Implemented exception handling that populates the `Error` collection on invalid query (e.g., negative index)
- Ensured the `Error` table is not created in the database, even though it is used in the code
- Additionally, attempted to configure all of the above without using DataAnnotations, relying only on **Fluent API**

### 3. Model Relationships and Inheritance
- Opened the project from lesson 2
- Implemented all entities and relationships as shown in the diagram
- Noted use of intermediate tables `Cart` and `KeyParams` to establish:
  - One-to-many relationship between **User** and **Product**
  - One-to-many relationship between **Keyword** and **Product**
- Performed migrations and updated the database
- Seeded the database with:
  - 2 users
  - 3 categories
  - 7 products with related keywords
- Output results to the console:
  - Displayed users with purchased products
  - Displayed all keywords assigned to each product
  - Displayed products within each category and their keywords
  - (Optionally) Displayed keywords assigned to each category
